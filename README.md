<img alt="Banner" height="125" src="assets/branding/PNG/Banners/CTGen_Header_BG_Logomark.png"/>

*Crafted Terrain Generation* (CTGen) allows you to generate entire Minecraft worlds with just one map image!
It's fully data-driven, so you can configure it entirely via data packs - no need for java code!
If you're a java coder, don't worry - CTGen also features a Java API, where you can configure everything of the mod!

CTGen builds your dream world, just the way you draw it on a map!
No matter if you want to play in a fantastic world like the world in [Game of Thrones] or are searching for a way to implement your custom mod-pack lore, CTGen realises your dream!
There's already an amazing mod using CTGen for the world of [Game of Thrones] - the [A Storm of Swords] mod.
